# Wine Quality Dataset Wrangling

This repository contains the code and documentation for wrangling and analyzing a wine quality dataset. The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009?resource=download), which includes various attributes and quality ratings of different wines.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to explore and analyze the wine quality dataset to gain insights into the factors affecting the quality of wines. We will perform data wrangling tasks to clean and preprocess the dataset, followed by conducting various analyses to understand the relationships between different attributes and wine quality.

## Dataset

The wine quality dataset consists of two separate datasets, one for red wines and another for white wines. Each dataset contains several attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, and more. Additionally, each wine is rated on a scale of 0 to 10 for its quality.

You can download the wine quality dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/download?datasetVersionNumber=2).

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   
   git clone https://github.com/Kanyelings/projects-3.10.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   `cd wine-quality-wrangling`
   

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file wine_quality_analysis.ipynb:

   
   `jupyter notebook wine_quality_analysis.ipynb`
   

2. This notebook is empty and should be filled up by those assigned to the exercise. All instructions are included in the notebook.

## Data Wrangling

The data wrangling process involves cleaning and preprocessing the wine quality dataset to make it suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, transforming data types, and performing any necessary data transformations.

The data wrangling code should be included in the Jupyter Notebook file wine_quality_analysis.ipynb.

## Data Analysis

Once the data is wrangled, we can perform various analyses to gain insights into the wine quality dataset. This may include visualizations, statistical analyses, correlation studies, and more.

The data analysis code can also be included in the Jupyter Notebook file wine_quality_analysis.ipynb.
